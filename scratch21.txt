J means should_jump?
T means whatever we're calcuating now

readings A B C D / E F G H I (ones after slash only available in running mode)
false = space
true = hole

D = destination
AND D J as last ensures we jump onto ground
is_solid? X => OR X *

------
OR A T  # T = solid at A
AND B T # T = solid at A & B
AND C T # T = solid at A & B & C
NOT T J # J = at least one gap 
AND D J #  J = at least one gap in (A-C) & D is solid
WALK
------

        # J = jump possible and necessary soon
OR A T  # T = solid at A
AND B T # T = solid at A & B
AND C T # T = solid at A & B & C
NOT T J # J = at least one gap in jumpable range (must jump soon)
AND D J # J = jump needed soon and D is solid (jump possible)

        # J = jump is also "not instant death"
OR E T  # T = E is solid
OR H T  # T = E or H is solid ergo "not instant death"
AND T J # J = possible, necessary, has non-lethal options
RUN
